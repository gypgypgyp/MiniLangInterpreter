Scope:
  - keep let expression; explain with good examples in lecture
  - avoid side effects
  - write a type checker, provide it, but include bugs?
  - more expression types?
    - iterations over lists?  not useful unless we have side effects
    
  - ask students to define some primitives

  - maybe a list type?  list-of-int, list-of-bool
  - additional expresison type
